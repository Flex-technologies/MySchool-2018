## Submitting changes

Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
